/* 
  Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean representing whter the array 
  is monotonic.

  An array is said to be monotinic if its elements, from left to right, are entirely non-incereasing or 
  entirely non-decresing.

  Non-increasing elements aren't necessarily exlusively decreasing: they simply don't increase. Similarly,
  non-decreasing elements aren't necessarily exclusively increasing: they simply don't decrease.

  Note that empty arrays and arrays of one element are monotonic.

  INPUT:
  array = [-1, -5, -10, -1100, -1100, -1101, -1102, -9001]
  OUTPUT:
  true
